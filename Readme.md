# Digit Recognition Project (PART-1):

Using the following methods/algorithms for part-1 of this project:

1. Llinear and Logistic Regression, 
2. Non-Linear Features, 
3. Regularization, and 
4. Kernel tricks. 

To see how these methods can be used to solve a real life problem, the famous digit recognition problem using the MNIST (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) database is a perfect project to implement such techniques on.

The MNIST database contains binary images of handwritten digits commonly used to train image processing systems. The digits were collected from among Census Bureau employees and high school students. The database contains 60,000 training digits and 10,000 testing digits, all of which have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of 28 Ã— 28 pixels. Many methods have been tested with this dataset and in this project, you will get a chance to experiment with the task of classifying these images into the correct digit using some of the methods indicated above as Part - I of this project.

# Setup Details:

Use Python's **NumPy** numerical library for handling arrays and array operations; use **matplotlib** for producing figures and plots.

Note on software: For all the projects, we will use **python 3.6** augmented with the **NumPy** numerical toolbox, the **matplotlib** plotting toolbox. In this project, we will also use the **scikit-learn** package, which you could install in the same way you installed other packages, e.g. by conda install scikit-learn or pip install sklearn

Download mnist.tar.gz and untar it into a working directory. Use the following Google Drive Link as well:

[Google Drive Containing MNIST folder for this Project](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16P4PsmlIqk6FUxFNwJXzLrShrLshf_qw?usp=sharing)

The archive contains the various data files in the Dataset directory, along with the following python files:

* part1/linear_regression.py 
  * where you will implement linear regression
* part1/svm.py 
  * where you will implement support vector machine
* part1/softmax.py 
  * where you will implement multinomial regression
* part1/features.py 
  * where you will implement principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction
* part1/kernel.py 
  * where you will implement polynomial and Gaussian RBF kernels
* part1/main.py 
  * where you will use the code you write for this part of the project

Important: The archive also contains files for the second part of the MNIST project. For this project, you will only work with the part1 folder.

To get warmed up to the MNIST data set run python main.py. This file provides code that reads the data from mnist.pkl.gz by calling the function get_MNIST_data that is provided for you in utils.py. The call to get_MNIST_data returns Numpy arrays:

* train_x : A matrix of the training data. Each row of train_x contains the features of one image, which are simply the raw pixel values flattened out into a vector of length 784=282. The pixel values are float values between 0 and 1 (0 stands for black, 1 for white, and various shades of gray in-between).
* train_y : The labels for each training datapoint, also known as the digit shown in the corresponding image (a number between 0-9).
* test_x : A matrix of the test data, formatted like train_x.
* test_y : The labels for the test data, which should only be used to evaluate the accuracy of different classifiers in your report.

Next, we call the function plot_images to display the first 20 images of the training set. Look at these images and get a feel for the data (don't include these in your write-up).

# Linear Regression with Closed Form Solution:

It can be argued that we can apply a linear regression model, as the labels are numbers from 0-9. Though being a little doubtful, you decide to have a try and start simple by using the raw pixel values of each image as features.

There is a skeleton code **run_linear_regression_on_MNIST in main.py**, but it needs more to complete the code and make the model work. The following will cover how to complete this code:

To solve the linear regression problem, you recall the linear regression has a closed form solution:
