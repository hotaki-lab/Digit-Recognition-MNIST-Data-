# Introduction to the Handwritten Digit Recognition Project (PART-1):

Using the following methods/algorithms for part-1 of this project:

1. Llinear and Logistic Regression, 
2. Non-Linear Features, 
3. Regularization, and 
4. Kernel tricks. 

To see how these methods can be used to solve a real life problem, the famous digit recognition problem using the MNIST (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) database is a perfect project to implement such techniques on.

The MNIST database contains binary images of handwritten digits commonly used to train image processing systems. The digits were collected from among Census Bureau employees and high school students. The database contains 60,000 training digits and 10,000 testing digits, all of which have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of 28 Ã— 28 pixels. Many methods have been tested with this dataset and in this project, you will get a chance to experiment with the task of classifying these images into the correct digit using some of the methods you have learned so far.
